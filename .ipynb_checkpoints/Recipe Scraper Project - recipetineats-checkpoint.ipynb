Here, we combine these two powerhouse veggies with fragrant garlic, bright lemon juice, and herbaceous dill to create rich flavor in this classic Italian rice dish. Wholesome, fiber-rich brown rice replaces traditional Arborio and soaks up a savory combination of veggie stock and white wine until every grain becomes deliciously tender. The end result is a skillet full of creamy, veggie-packed rice that will satisfy your belly and soothe your soul.

Mushrooms, chickpeas, and walnuts are finely chopped in a food processor and seasoned with a blend of smoky spices and herbs to create a savory plant-based chorizo that serves as the base of each roll. Smashed pinto beans, cilantro, scallions, and fresno chile are layered into each rice paper wrapper before everything is wrapped up like a baby burrito and toasted to crispy perfection in the air fryer. Serve with a side of salsa for dipping, and prepare to take your taste buds on a wildly delicious journey! If you want to switch it up, you can also try these spring rolls fresh and unfried.\n",

Orange sweet potatoes are mashed with zesty orange juice and warming pumpkin pie spice to create a custard-like filling, while steamed purple sweet potato petals are placed in an eye-catching rosette pattern and topped with crushed almonds. (Steaming the purple potatoes separately and adding them after baking ensures the best texture and color.) The nutty oat and almond crust contrasts nicely with the earthy sweetness of the tart filling, and you can top each slice with Aquafaba Whipped Cream if you want an extra dose of decadence. Serve up this jaw-dropping dessert when you want to impress guests and end your evening on a sweet note!\n",

The orange-hued base features sautéed onions, garlic, and thyme to create a rich bisque where every slurp tastes like a spoonful of liquid gold. The secret to producing the perfect velvety texture is to add a can of creamy butter beans into the mix and puree everything with an immersion blender. Once spooned into bowls, a drizzle of pepita and parsley pistou—a sauce that normally features basil and olive oil—is ideal for swirling into the soup. Serve this butternut bisque with a side of crusty whole grain bread for an extra hearty meal. \n",

A zesty lime and soy dressing seeps down among the layers to create an Asian-inspired flavor profile that will leave you licking your plate. This recipe is ideal for a light but filling lunch, or as a starting course paired with a denser noodle dish when you’re ready for a full-on feast.

While the colorful veggies are enough to make you salivate, the real star of the show is chickpeas, which get a triple appearance in this scrumptious dish. Each lettuce leaf is slathered in creamy hummus before being piled high with toppings, while whole chickpeas are tossed into the veggie mix and aquafaba (chickpea liquid) emulsifies the smoky citrus dressing. Romaine leaves are sturdy enough to act as edible flatware and add a satisfying crunch to each bite. When you want a veg-forward meal to fill a rumbling tummy, fire up the grill and whip up a batch of these wonderful wraps to satisfy your cravings.\n",

Sweet corn, bell peppers, poblano chiles, and onions are grilled to tender perfection and sliced into fajita-style strips before joining the pasta. A spicy lime vinaigrette is drizzled over the eye-catching jumble to pack each forkful with powerful flavors, while pinto beans and juicy tomatoes are added for extra substance. After divvying up the pasta salad into bowls, top each portion with slices of creamy avocado and crunchy pepitas to get the full Southwestern experience.\n"

      "Umami-rich mushrooms and earthy asparagus are the dream team when it comes to risotto. Here, we combine these two powerhouse veggies with fragrant garlic, bright lemon juice, and herbaceous dill to create rich flavor in this classic Italian rice dish. Wholesome, fiber-rich brown rice replaces traditional Arborio and soaks up a savory combination of veggie stock and white wine until every grain becomes deliciously tender. The end result is a skillet full of creamy, veggie-packed rice that will satisfy your belly and soothe your soul. Add a sprinkling of cheesy nutritional yeast for the perfect finishing touch, and then dig in! Tip: You can save veggie scraps to make your own broth. In an airtight container in your freezer, collect scraps from fresh mushrooms, onions, carrots, celery, potatoes, red and yellow peppers, tomatoes, squash, and herbs. Once you have 8 cups of scraps, place them in a large pot, cover with water, and simmer for 2 hours or until broth is flavorful. Strain and refrigerate or freeze broth.

      "https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes//recipes/vegan-snacks-appetizers/air-fried-southwest-spring-rolls/\n",
      "Sink your teeth into a creative combination of Southwest taco flavors wrapped up in the form of a spring roll. Mushrooms, chickpeas, and walnuts are finely chopped in a food processor and seasoned with a blend of smoky spices and herbs to create a savory plant-based chorizo that serves as the base of each roll. Smashed pinto beans, cilantro, scallions, and fresno chile are layered into each rice paper wrapper before everything is wrapped up like a baby burrito and toasted to crispy perfection in the air fryer. Serve with a side of salsa for dipping, and prepare to take your taste buds on a wildly delicious journey! If you want to switch it up, you can also try these spring rolls fresh and unfried. Tip: Choose a salsa that is on the thicker side but not too chunky or piecey; that way it will stick to the spring rolls when dipped. Note: Some chili powders are cut with wheat flour, making them unsuitable for people with gluten allergies. If gluten is a concern, make sure to check the ingredient to ensure it is pure chili powder. For more healthy air-fryer recipes, check out these tasty ideas:\n",
      "https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes//recipes/vegan-desserts/sweet-potato-rosette-tart/\n",
      "This stunning sweet potato tart uses two different types of tubers to achieve the scrumptious end result. Orange sweet potatoes are mashed with zesty orange juice and warming pumpkin pie spice to create a custard-like filling, while steamed purple sweet potato petals are placed in an eye-catching rosette pattern and topped with crushed almonds. (Steaming the purple potatoes separately and adding them after baking ensures the best texture and color.) The nutty oat and almond crust contrasts nicely with the earthy sweetness of the tart filling, and you can top each slice with Aquafaba Whipped Cream if you want an extra dose of decadence. Serve up this jaw-dropping dessert when you want to impress guests and end your evening on a sweet note! For more vegan sweet potato desserts, check out these tasty recipes:\n",
      "https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes//recipes/vegan-soups-stews/butternut-bisque-with-parsley-pistou/\n",
      "Silky smooth, packed full of flavor, and topped with a French-inspired variation on pesto, this butternut squash bisque is what soup dreams are made of. The orange-hued base features sautéed onions, garlic, and thyme to create a rich bisque where every slurp tastes like a spoonful of liquid gold. The secret to producing the perfect velvety texture is to add a can of creamy butter beans into the mix and puree everything with an immersion blender. Once spooned into bowls, a drizzle of pepita and parsley pistou—a sauce that normally features basil and olive oil—is ideal for swirling into the soup. Serve this butternut bisque with a side of crusty whole grain bread for an extra hearty meal. For more soup inspiration, check out these tasty ideas:\n",
      "https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes//recipes/vegan-snacks-appetizers/pinto-bean-spread/\n",
      "The following recipe is adapted from Seed to Plate, Soil to Sky: Modern Plant-Based Recipes Using Native American Ingredients by Lois Ellen Frank with culinary adviser Walter Whitewater. Read our Q&A with chefs Frank and Whitewater here. Chef Walter grew up eating pinto beans all the time, and he loves this bean spread served on sandwiches, toast, and with freshly cut vegetables for a family gathering or celebration. I use this spread on my toast in the morning for a quick, nutritious breakfast. For an ancestral twist, try making it with brown tepary beans (S-oam Bavi), white tepary beans (S-totoah Bavi), and black tepary beans (S-chuuk Bavi). We find that blackening garlic is well worth the extra 10 minutes of prep time. It softens the flavor of raw garlic and brings an earthy quality to any dish.

      "Perfectly fluffy and a dreamy shade of green, this delicious spinach hummus combines classic hummus ingredients with the earthy goodness of fresh spinach to create a scrumptious spread that’s picturesque enough to serve as an appetizer at your next party while still being kid-friendly. The secret to getting a light and fluffy texture is to add a few ice cubes when blending—a handy trick to keep in mind for other hummus recipes! Serve this stunning oil-free spinach hummus as a dip with pita squares, crackers, or crudités. It’s also excellent as a fresh, flavorful spread on sandwiches or wraps.
